Scripts to setup the MD simulations and to analyze the output data are included.  All Relevant output data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files. Extensive metadata will be uploaded at the HeiDATA repository of the Heidelberg University soon.   

The data is divided in four sections:
1) README-I: generation of complete model of the VAR2CSA head region in complex with the CSA 21 chain.
2) README-II:  Equilibrium, Force-probe, and MD-docking Molecular dynamics simulations
3) README-III:  Molecular docking
4) Force distribution analysis: FDA directory
