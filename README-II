##### MD SIMULATIONS FILES

!! Important note: these files are provided as is! scripts and top files include original file names. Paths need to be adapted by the user to their system!!

!! tpr files should work for gromacs 2021 or newer.


TPR, GRO files, topologies, and other necessary files to generate the TPR files, for each step in the setup from minimization -> equilibation (nvt, npt) -> production can be found in the resprective directories:

MD-equil/ ... equilibirum simulations VAR2CSA/CSA comlex
MD-pull/ ... force-probe simulations
MD-dock-equil/ ... equilibrium simulations of VAR2CSA complex with CSA-dodecamer docked to cryptic binding sites

_pp.* is without water for processing and visualization purposes.


MDP files are also provided. 




##### MD analysis:
The analysis code reported in the methods can be found in
analysis-var2csa.ipynb and review-var2csa.ipynb.

Time-traces of the observables extracted from the simulations are provided in xvg format.
