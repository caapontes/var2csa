The data is divided in four sections:
1) README-I: generation of complete model of the VAR2CSA head region in complex with the CSA 21 chain.
2) README-II:  Equilibrium, Force-probe, and MD-docking Molecular dynamics simulations
3) README-III:  Molecular docking
4) Force distribution analysis: FDA directory

Compressed file var2csa_roessner.tar.gz contains all relevant input and output simulation files, as well as code to setup the simulations and analyze the results. It is ~20 GB uncompressed. To access the data please download and decompress the file with:
