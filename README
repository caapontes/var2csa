---------------------------
Here you will find the input GROMACS tpr and mdp files, along with the scripts to setup and analyze the simulation data.

Relevant output data is included in the manuscript (mentioned above) and is going to also be avaliable as an extended data set at the heiDATA repository of the Heidelberg University. 
---------------------------


The data is divided in four sections:
1) README-I: generation of complete model of the VAR2CSA head region in complex with the CSA 21 chain.
2) README-II:  Equilibrium, Force-probe, and MD-docking Molecular dynamics simulations
3) README-III:  Molecular docking
4) Force distribution analysis: FDA directory
