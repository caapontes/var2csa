##### DOCKING #####

##### A) Selection of conformations from pulling simulations as input for HADDOCK
./MD/snapshots-for-docking/MD-dock/*/dist_09_nm.pdb
ensemble-open-conformations-for-docking.sh

#OUTPUT:
./MD/snapshots-for-docking/MD-dock/dist-09+sugar.pdb


##### B) HADDOCK INPUT FILES:
# Ensemble of 20 conformations obtained in A
# CSA 11mer from cryo-EM 7jgh structure:
./structures/csa-11mer-7jgh.pdb


##### C) OUTPUT CONFORMATIONS AFTER DOCKING:
docking/minor-binding-site/cluster*.pdb
docking/dbl4-major-binding-site/cluster*.pdb


##### D) correct Hydrogens of sugars in docked conformations:
correct_H-sugars_docking_poses.sh

#OUTPUT (energy-minimized in vacuum conformations and topology):
./docking/*-binding-site/*/*gro
./docking/dbl4-major-binding-site/topol.top
./docking/dbl4-major-binding-site/toppar/
# These conformations were used for further equilibrium MD simulations. See protocol in README-II and methods.
